10: ARPANET
***********

The beginning...::

   "We set up a telephone connection between us and the guys at SRI ...", Kleinrock ... said in an interview: "We typed the L and we asked on the phone,

   "Do you see the L?"
   "Yes, we see the L," came the response.
   We typed the O, and we asked, "Do you see the O."
   "Yes, we see the O."
   Then we typed the G, and the system crashed ...
   Yet a revolution had begun" ....[10]

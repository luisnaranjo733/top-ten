3: Cuban Missile Crisis
***********************

Letter From Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 26, 1962::

   "Mr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in
   which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the
   tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be
   tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it,
   and then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is not
   for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of what
   terrible forces our countries dispose.

   Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom
   the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax
   the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that
   knot. We are ready for this."

Synopsis
========

In October 1962, an American U-2 spy plane secretly photographed nuclear missile
sites being built by the Soviet Union on Cuba.

On October 22, 1962 U.S. President John F. Kennedy announced to the world
that the Soviets were building secret missile bases just 90 miles off the
east coast, on Cuba.

The option of an armed invasion on Cuba with airstrikes was on the table,
but ultimately Kennedy decided to be more cautious.

He demanded that Russian Premiere Nikita S. Khrushchev abort his mission
in cuba. To enfore this, he put in place an American naval blockade.

We went on the brink of nuclear warfare when Nikita authorized his field
commanders to fire their tactical nuclear weapons of attacked by the Ame
ricans.

As many have put it "the two leaders of the world's greatest nuclear
superpowers stared each other down for seven days - until Khrushchev blinked."



What effects did it have?
=========================

This teeter totter between peace and nuclear warfare shocked the world.

It stirred an already existing global debate about the U.S. and Soviet
Unions' use of nuclear weapons.

It also caused even more anti-communist sentiment stateside, as well as
fear. Even more bomb bunkers were built as people prepared for the worst.

Public fear is evident even during Seattle's world fair in 1962::

   "We cannot see into the future to visualize the Seattle of 2012, but we
   can hope and imagine. In the year 2012 Seattle will either be a mighty
   metropolis of more than 1,000,000 residents -- or it will have become a
   charred, deserted relic of a fearful age of nuclear warfare. This year of
   1962 will have been a troubled one as you will have read in history."

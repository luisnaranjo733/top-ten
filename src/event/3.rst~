3: The Wright Brothers take to the skies
****************************************

Synopsis
========

Throughout history, human beings have had a desire to fly.

In 1903, the United States tried to develop an airplane, 
and failed::

   "In 1 million to 10 million years they might be able to make a plane that would fly."
     -The New York Times

Eigth days after the New York Times made this statement, In Kitty Hawk, NC; Wilbur and 
Orville Wright conducted the first successful 'heavier than air' flight ever.

Their airplane was propellor driven, and it was able to stay up in the air for 12 seconds
on its' first round.

They had 3 more successful flights that day, with very little media coverage.

After only a few years, they managed to stay in the air for over an hour!

What effects did it have?
=========================

The invention of the airplane had major implications in the upcoming years.

During WWI, the plane was used for espionage.

During WWII, the plane was a major tool of destruction, fitted with powerful
weaponry.

For example, the plane made a big impact in the Battle of London where the 
war was almost lost to the Axis powers.

Today, it is still used as a war machine, but now its' usage is extended to 
quickly and effectively transporting goods and people from one place to another.

Never before have humans been able to travel so quickly, lightly, effectively, and easily.
